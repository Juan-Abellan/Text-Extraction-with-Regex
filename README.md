# Text-Extraction-with-Regex

## Background & Objectives

In this exercise we are going to use Regular Expressions in order to extract data from a plain text file.

## Data

The receipts in this file are from a restaurant. Each receipt gives us how many plates were served and how much money the restaurant made that day.


## Tools

For this exercise we will work with a Python Jupyter Notebook using libraries as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and regex.
